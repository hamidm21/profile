    I started my journey as a software developer in 2017. I hold a master’s degree in Computer Engineering. I have co-founded multiple software startups over the years and have failed so hard each time that I'm into philosophy now :) </br> 
    Regarding my scientific interests, I'm passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Social Science, and Financial Forecasting. My thesis focused on rethinking sentiment analysis in financial tweets. </br>
